# Coding Principles and Guidelines

## SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting correctness.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

## General Coding Guidelines

- Use meaningful and descriptive variable and function names.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Use functional components and hooks in React.
- Avoid code duplication by creating reusable components.
- Write unit tests for critical components and functions.
- Use consistent code formatting and linting.
- Document components and functions with comments where necessary.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback.
- Follow accessibility best practices.

## Testing

- Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- Write tests for components, utilities, and services.
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for business logic.

## Performance

- Use React Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Optimize rendering by using memoization and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- Lazy load components and assets where appropriate.
